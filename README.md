# Quick Start

```
pip install -U pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
python example_model.py
```

The example script model will produce a `validation_predictions.csv` file which you can upload at
https://numer.ai/tournament to get model diagnostics.

> TIP: The example_model.py script takes ~45-60 minutes to run. If you don't want to wait, you can upload
> `example_diagnostic_predictions.csv` to get diagnostics immediately.

If the current round is open (Saturday 18:00 UTC through Monday 14:30 UTC), you can submit your predictions and start
getting results on live tournament data. You can create your submission by uploading the `example_predictions.csv` or
generated `tournament_predictions.csv`
file at https://numer.ai/tournament

# Next Steps

## Research

The example model is a good baseline model, but we can do much better. Check out example_model_advanced for the best model made by Numerai's internal research team (takes 2~3 hours to run!) and learn more about the underlying concepts used to construct the advanced example model in the analysis_and_tips notebook.

Check out the [forums](https://forum.numer.ai/) for in depth discussions on model research.

## Staking

Once you have a model you are happy with, you can stake [NMR](https://www.coinbase.com/price/numeraire) on it to start earning rewards.

Head over to the [website](https://numer.ai/tournament) to get started or read more about staking in our [official rules and getting started guide](https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/learn#staking).

## Automation

You can upload your predictions directly to our [GraphQL API](https://api-tournament.numer.ai/) or through the [Python client](https://github.com/uuazed/numerapi/).

To access the API, you must first create your API keys in your [account page](https://numer.ai/account) and provide them to the client:

```python
example_public_id = "somepublicid"
example_secret_key = "somesecretkey"
napi = numerapi.NumerAPI(example_public_id, example_secret_key)
```

After instantiating the NumerAPI client with API keys, you can then upload your submissions programmatically:

```python
# upload predictions
model_id = napi.get_models()['your_model_name']
napi.upload_predictions("tournament_predictions.csv", model_id=model_id, version=2) # version=2 for the ~1K features
```

The recommended setup for a fully automated submission process is to use Numerai Compute. Please see the
[Numerai CLI documentation](https://github.com/numerai/numerai-cli) for instructions on how to deploy your
models to AWS.

# FAQ

### What are the system requirements?

- Minimum: 16GB RAM and 4 core (Intel i5) / 6 cores (AMD Ryzen 5)
- Recommended: 32GB RAM and 8 core (Intel i7/i9) / 12 cores (AMD Ryzen 7/9)

### What exactly is in the Numerai dataset?

The Numerai Dataset contains decades of historical data on the global stock market. Each era represents a time period and each id represents a stock. The features are made from market and fundamental measures of the companies, and the targets are a measure of return.

The stock ids, features, and targets are intentionally obfuscated.

### How often is the dataset updated?

The historical portions of the dataset (training_data, validation_data) are relatively static and is updated about every 3-6 months, usually with just more rows.

The live portion of the dataset (tournament_data) is updated every week and represents the latest state of the global stock market.

### What is Parquet?

[Parquet](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) is an efficient and performant file format that is IO optimized for reading in subsets of columns at a time.

Use the parquet versions (instead of the standard CSV) of the dataset files to minimize time spent on IO (downloading and reading the file into memory).

Use the int8 version (features are stored as int8 instead of the standard float32) of the parquet file to further minimize memory usage.

### What is the "new" vs "legacy" dataset?

In September of 2021, Numerai released a new version of the dataset. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/numerai/numerais-super-massive-data-release-d3ca4a7a5feb).

Models trained on the legacy dataset will continue to work, but it is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to the new dataset because of the major performance improvements.

All example code in this repo has been updated to work with the new dataset only.

### Where can I find this legacy dataset?

You can continue to download the legacy dataset from the website and the API, but it will be eventually deprecated.

Use the `dataset` query in the [GraphQL API](https://api-tournament.numer.ai/) _without passing any round number_ to download the legacy dataset zip.

### How should I migrate my legacy models to the new dataset?

The easiest way to get started with the new dataset is to check out the new example models and analysis and tips notebook in this repo.

Also check out this [deep dive](https://forum.numer.ai/t/super-massive-data-release-deep-dive/4053) on the new dataset in the forum.
